# Threads---Day-3

Sequential time: 14.02 Seconds

Parallel time(threaded): 3.06 Seconds

As seen above, the threaded parallel way of approaching this task is close to 5 times faster than the standard sequential way.

The speed does rely on a bunch of other factors but i do think its safe to say that it will always be faster to use threads for this specific task.
